# Use R package Seurat to analysi scRNA data

## Team member: 
Mengling He


## Background:  

Seurat is a popular R package designed for the analysis and visualization of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. 
Contrasts with traditional bulk RNA-seq analyses, single-cell data analysis refers to the process of examining data obtained from individual cells to understand their molecular characteristics and behaviors at a highly detailed level.

## Goals
- Explore the different modules in the Seurat package, and find out how it is structured into different modules that handle different aspects of single-cell data analysis
- Analyze an open source single-cell data https://cells.ucsc.edu/human-sputum/ using Seurat to do cell clustering.
